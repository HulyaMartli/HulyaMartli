# Hulya | Guerillagi | Hulu

Hey there <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8e7b06ecf583bc040eb60e44eb5b8e0ecc5421320a92929ce21522dbc34c891/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f6876524a434c467a6361737252346961377a2f67697068792e676966" alt="Waving Hand" width="30">

I am Hulya, aka. Guerillagi. I started my coding journey while studying Chemical Engineering 👩🏻‍🔬 but I realized I wanted to spend my life surrounded by design 🎨 and coding 👩🏻‍💻 rather than pursuing engineering. Thus, I am trying to explore ways to express myself through art and programming. I generally gained experience in the management departments; that was the path life offered me at that time. Still, I worked in the art/architecture business for 2.5 years assisting both art gallery and architecture offices of the same company; and worked in the tech business for 2 years, assisting customers and teams with technical support, content publishing, translation, organization and management. So, I was fortunately involved with both art and tech throughout these years. You can always check my other <a href="#platforms">accounts</a> to learn more about me.

Nowadays, I am all about learning something new, and I am in a career transition full of excitement, constant learning, and code to death kind of period!

The best quote explains why I want to be a top-shelf Front-end Developer:

> ***"Front-end Developer is someone that likes being in the intersection of art and logic. So, if you like programming but also like the artistic side of design and working with customers, being a front-end engineer is the perfect role for you."*** <br> -Codecademy

## 🤹🏻‍♀️ **Fun Fact About My Nickname** ***"Guerillagi"***
When I meet someone new, one of the questions they first ask is why my nickname is *Guerillagi* all over the place and what it means. So I wanted to add it here as a fun fact.

In high school, I was crazy about this group called [Guerilla Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls). They are a group of female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world, and their creations: the posters, slogans, etc., were so amazing ([check their website](https://www.guerrillagirls.com/)) that I always dreamed of being one of them. So, I am trying to remember which platform I was signing up to, but it was around 2007 or 2008; maybe it was Twitter? :D I am not sure, though. So, I was creating a new account for that platform, and I wanted the nickname "GuerillaGirl," but it was already taken, of course. :/, and then I started deleting letters to see which nickname was available... Guerillagi was available, and I loved the sound of it! :D Like it was meant to be my nickname for good. After that, I started using it everywhere on the web. So, yes, it is that boring story actually, nothing special about it!

But it is special because my nickname means something significant to me, and it reminds me that we, women, have suffered a lot just because of our gender from the past to today. I don't want to believe that, but unfortunately, this discrimination still exists worldwide. I always thought there should be an organization like "Guerilla Girls" in every occupational group, which brings me to think about the place of women in the tech world today; unfortunately, there are so few of us in this market. I want to be one of the women who change that; I want to be successful in software so I can raise women's count in this sector while doing the things I love and enjoy: coding and design!
