Hey there <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8e7b06ecf583bc040eb60e44eb5b8e0ecc5421320a92929ce21522dbc34c891/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f6876524a434c467a6361737252346961377a2f67697068792e676966" alt="Waving Hand" width="30">

I am Hulya, aka. Guerillagi. I started my coding journey while studying Chemical Engineering 👩🏻‍🔬 but I realized I wanted to spend my life surrounded with design 🎨 and coding 👩🏻‍💻 rather than pursuing engineering. Nowadays, I am all about Front-End Development and trying to explore ways to express myself through design and coding. I generally gained experience in the management area; that was the path life offered me at that time. Still, I also worked as a Technical Suppor Specialist for approximately 1 year, so I was fortunately involved with technology. You can always check my <a href="#linkedin">LinkedIn profile</a> for more details.


Nowadays, I am all about Front-End Development and exploring ways to express myself through design and coding. I am trying to accomplish one of my dreams of being a Frontend/UI Developer/Designer, and I am in a career transition full of excitement, constant learning, and code to death kind of period!

### **Fun Fact About My Nickname** ***"Guerillagi"***

When I meet someone new, one of the questions they first ask is why my nickname is *Guerillagi* all over the place and what it means. So I wanted to add it here as a fun fact.

In high school, I was crazy about this group called [Guerilla Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls). They are a group of female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world, and their creations: the posters, slogans, etc., were so amazing ([check their website](https://www.guerrillagirls.com/)) that I always dreamed of being one of them. So, I am trying to remember which platform I was signing in to, but it was around 2007 or 2008; maybe it was Twitter? :D I am not sure, though, so I was creating a new account for that platform, and I wanted the nickname "GuerillaGirl," but it was already taken, of course. :/, and then I started deleting letters to see which nickname was available... Guerillagi was available, and I loved the sound of it! :D Like it was meant to be my nickname for good. After that, I started using it everywhere on the web. So, yes, it is that boring story actually, nothing special about it!

But it is special because my nickname means something significant to me, and it reminds me that we, women, have suffered a lot just because of our gender from the past to today. I don't want to believe that, but unfortunately, this discrimination still exists worldwide. I always thought there should be an organization like "Guerilla Girls" in every occupational group, which brings me to think about the place of women in the tech world today; unfortunately, there are so few of us in this market. I want to be one of the women who change that; I want to be successful in software so I can raise women's count in this sector while doing the things I love and enjoy: coding and design!
